# BankniftyRangePrediction-
I have made this model for my personal use where it can predict the next day range(High - Low)

I use this model for my personal use, where it can predict the next day range.Getting the range for the next day can be a good factor to trade in the market.
Have used 3 different algorithms and the mean squared error is as follows:
Random Forest Mean Squared Error: 76235.36971047196
Gradient Boosting Mean Squared Error: 65554.25929530173
Ensemble Mean Squared Error: 69089.49989305991

Although the accuracy is not that good but still it makes a good difference as I use other factors too with this model and it helps a lot
trying to improve the model
